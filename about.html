                <h1>Who Am I</h1>
                <p>My name is Keletso Maduma was born in a small town, Burgersfort in Limpopo/Mpumalanga 
                    completed my high scool studies in 2014 and went to collage to study Diesel mechanical N2-N5 at Sekhukhune FET College, previously 
                    known as Dr. CN Phathudi. In 2016 Started my first year at Tshwane University Of technology,in Soshanguve south Campus studying 
                    National Diploma in Computer Systems Engineering.

                    survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in 
                    the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing
                     software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum. 
                     <br><br>
                     Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, 
                     making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin 
                     words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. 
                     Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. 
                     This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. 
                     The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.
